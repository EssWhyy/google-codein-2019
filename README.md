R is a free, open-source programming language mainly used for statistical analysis and visualisation. R consists of many different optional packages with useful functions for common tasks. (E.g.: ggplot2, dplyr, odbc) I did an analysis on the downloads of all available R-packages using R itself, along with making some custom hexagonal logos for 3 different packages.
